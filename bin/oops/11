Can an interface extend more than one interface in Dart?
Dart has the ability to implement several interfaces. The keyword implements allows a class to adhere to multiple interfaces
and increase an object's polymorphic range. The keyword implement is followed by an existing named class whose public fields
then become implementation requirements for the current class.
