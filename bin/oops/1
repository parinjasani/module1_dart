What is inheritance?
-->
-Inheritance in dart is defined as the process in which one class derive the properties and characteristics of another class.
It is helpful as it provides an ability with which we can create a new class from an existing class.

-Inheritance is a major component of a programming paradigm known as OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming).

-With the help of Inheritance, one class can make use of all the properties and characteristics of another class.

-In general, two classes are required for inheritance and these mainly are −

1)Parent class - A class that is inherited by the other class is known as the parent class. Sometimes, we also refer it to as the base class.

2)Child class - A class that inherits the properties and characteristics of the parent class is known as child class.
